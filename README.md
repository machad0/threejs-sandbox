You can easily add objects on the scene, just change the config.json file:

```{
    "elements": [{
        "url": "http://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/gallery/30-impossibly-cute-puppies/impossibly-cute-puppy-30.jpg",
        "width": 680,
        "height": 453,
        "x": -650,
        "y": -100,
        "z": -600,
        "rx": 0,
        "ry": -1400,
	"rz": 0
    }]
}```

to run it locally just:

```
npm install
```
then:

```
gulp
```

live demo soon
